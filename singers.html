		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shea Diamond is an African American singer from Little Rock, Arkansas.  She was raised in Memphis and later moved to Flint, Michigan.  She began singing from a young age, when her voice was still high enough to match other women.  Since she felt oppressed in her home, and was unable to hide the fact that she was trans, she left home at the age of 14.  She committed a crime and later spent 10 years in a men’s prison.  It is here where her musical career took off, as she was able to write the song “I Am Her” inspired by the other trans women in men’s jails (AllMusic).<br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shea Diamond was selected because being Black and incarcerated is an issue dealt with by the Black community.  Often times, Black people will be taken to prison at a higher rate than their white counterparts.  She also sings empowering songs about Black femininity, such as “Keisha Complexion”.  Diamond also wants to share her experiences as a trans woman, and show that no matter how she is treated by others, or whether she is accepted, rejected, misunderstood, or denied by them, she will continue to proudly live as a Black trans woman.</p>

		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drebae is a queer, femme artist who became popular after performing at Pride.  He struggled with being a non-straight, masculine rapper, but continued to make music after Pride Month.  In his songs, he tries to eliminate the homophobic language that many rappers use.  He is devoted to making songs throughout the year, hopefully picking up success after Pride Month is over.  His interview with Billboard helped cement his career, and he is still continuing to produce music (Escalera). <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drebae is included in this selection of artists because it is important to celebrate queer, femme males, especially Black males.  In his songs, he includes a lot of gay-coded language, as well as references to Black culture.  His makeup and fashion allows him to express a femininity hardly seen in Black men.  He also uplifts Black voices by including Black-coded language to promote Black pride.  His collaboration with Megan Three Stallion in “No Pressure” combines the power of two Black artists to form a powerful song.</p>
