		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langston Hughes is remembered for his work during the Harlem Renaissance, a time when Black poets became prolific.  Hughes was influenced by jazz musicians, Walt Whitman, and Paul Laurence Dunbar.  He was also a novelist and playwright, with audiences overseas.  There is agreement among historians and academics that Hughes was gay and that many of his poems included gay themes, like Walt Whitman.  It is especially prominent in the story “Blessed Assurance”.  He may have had a love affair with the singer Gilbert Price, and a man named “Beauty” (University of Illinois, Springfield). <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is especially important to Black culture because of the popularity of his poems.  He is known for bringing his homosexuality into his art.  His poetry is beautiful and a must-have for any exhibit for Black history.  There were so many poems to choose from, and it was difficult deciding which poetry to include for this project.  However, some, such as “Blessed Assurance”, were very clearly needed. <br> </p>

		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audre Lorde is a poet and wrote “From a Land Where Other People Live” and “The Black Unicorn”.  She attended Hunter College and Columbia University and published her first volume of poetry, First Cities, in 1968.  She is known for being a writer who covers issues of race, gender, and sexuality.  This began when she was a teenager, and she obtained a master’s degree in library science in 1961.  After publishing her first poetry, she left her job as head librarian in Town School Library, later teaching poetry at a workshop at Tougaloo College, John Jay College, and Hunter College.  She also wrote a memoir about her fight with cancer in The Cancer Journals. She spent her last years at the US Virgin Islands (Biography) <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lorde was selected for the museum exhibit because she examined race, gender, and sexuality as a poet.  She first wrote about her sexuality in a poem called “Martha”.  Her later work, New York Head Shop and Museum, provided a more thorough overview of her politics.  In The Black Unicorn, she wrote about her African heritage and also wrote about being a woman of color, a lesbian, a mother, and a feminist in her other poems.  She is important to Black culture because of this, and has contributed a lot to the rights of Black LGBTQ+ youth.</p><br>

Yes foolish prejudice lies<br>
I hear you Martha<br>
that you would never harm my children<br>
but you have forgotten their names<br>
and that you are Elizabeth's godmother.<br>
And you offer me coral rings, watches<br>
even your body<br>
if I will help you sneak home.<br><br>

No Martha my blood is not muddy my hands<br>
are not dirty to touch<br>
Martha I do not know your night nurse's name<br>
even though she is black<br>
yes I did in Brighton Beach once<br>
which is almost Rockaway<br>
one bitter winter<br>
but not with your night nurse Martha<br>
and yes I agree this is one hell<br>
of a summer.<br><br>

No you cannot walk yet Martha<br>
and no the medicines you are given<br>
to quiet your horrors<br>
have not affected your brain<br>
yes it is very hard to think but<br>
it is getting easier and yes Martha<br>
we have loved each other and yes I hope<br>
we still can<br>
no Martha I do not know if we shall ever<br>
sleep in each other's arms again.<br></p>
